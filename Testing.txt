o/p: *The symptoms of abdominal swelling, easy bruising, changes in stool and urine color, and jaundice may indicate liver disease. 
    Liver dysfunction can cause bilirubin buildup, leading to jaundice and color changes in urine and stools. 
    It can also result in ascites (abdominal swelling) and clotting issues from low platelets or clotting factor deficiencies. 
    Consulting a healthcare professional for tests like liver function tests or an ultrasound is advisable to confirm the diagnosis.*
